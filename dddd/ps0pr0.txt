What was the most interesting or important idea in this article for you – and why?

The most interesting or important idea was the creation of the program that allows people to create a watercolor painting screen on computer. With the development computer algorithms such as machine learning and AI, computer algorithms are now taking over what humans have been doing for the past centuries. Watercolor painting, which I believed are things that only humans could physical do on paper, will be able to do online, using this program. What was even more surprising is that the sophisticated programming done by the Whiting team allows every action done by the user to be different and unique, which I thought was impossible for computer. When computers are given the same task, they simply follow the same algorithm and create the same results. However, Whiting includes that the method used by this programming creates “something that has a physical aspect to it,” allowing variations within the copies.
